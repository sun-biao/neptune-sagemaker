This folder contains code snippets and samples referenced by the book as well as additional sample files. More samples will be added over time.


Note that files with a ".groovy" extension but with all lowercase names are intended to be launched from within the Gremlin Console. Files with a ".groovy" extenstion and capitalized names, such as TinkerGraphTest.groovy, are stand alone groovy applications that should be run from outside of the console using the groovy runtime.

Files with a ".java" extension are stand alone Java applications that need to be compiled and run using a Java JDK.

Files with a ".py" extension are stand alone Python applications that require the Gremlin Python library to have been installed using PIP or an equivalent method. 

Some of the samples use data from CSV files that can be found in the *'/sample-data'* folder.
